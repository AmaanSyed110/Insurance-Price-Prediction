## Description
The Insurance Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict insurance prices based on various factors. The dataset includes features such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, region, and expenses. By analyzing these attributes, the project seeks to uncover the underlying relationships and patterns that influence insurance pricing. The goal is to build a predictive model that insurance companies can use to estimate premiums more accurately, enabling them to make informed decisions and provide competitive pricing to customers. Additionally, this project could aid individuals in understanding the factors that impact their insurance costs, empowering them to make educated choices regarding their health and lifestyle.
